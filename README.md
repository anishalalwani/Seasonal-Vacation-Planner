This is a website project I created to learn basics of website development as "Beyond The Syllabus" project. This project was not a part of my curriculum. 

This project uses the following technologies:

1. Web development based project to create a website that displays holiday destinations based on different seasons of the year wherein the user can book hotels directly from the website.
2. Achieved a clean looking user-interface using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript while the backend was developed using PHP to communicate with the MySQL database.
